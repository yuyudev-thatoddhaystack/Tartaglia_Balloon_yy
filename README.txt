A balloon for the Ukagaka "Tartaglia". Made for Ghost Jam 2021, and as such not all the flaws are ironed out. Still, I'd rather release it out to the world as flawed rather than keep it locked up forever.

I made this a while ago so I don't remember exactly, but I think I used the same font used in Genshin Impact for the input boxes.
